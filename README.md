Jekyll Minima Theme ported to WordPress


## Why?

I just like the simplicity of the Minima theme from Jekyll.  Some Google searches turned up empty for a Minima theme port to WordPress so I spent a half hour hacking the theme up myself.

## Status

Alpha - I do not recommend you running this on production sites.

## Todo

- Add comment system
- Add nav menu and replace static "About" and "Tools" (sorry hehe)
- Sidebar:  No plans
- Cleanup CSS
- Cleanup HTML
- Fix WordPress function references and optimize loop
