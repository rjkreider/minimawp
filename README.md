Jekyll Minima Theme ported to WordPress

## Demo

I'm currently developing and using this WordPress theme on [https://techish.net/](https://techish.net/)

## Why?

I just like the simplicity of the Minima theme from Jekyll.  Some Google searches turned up empty for a Minima theme port to WordPress so I spent a half hour hacking the theme up myself.

## Status

Alpha - I do not recommend you running this on production sites.

## Todo

In order of priority for me personally.

- ~~add nav menu and replace static "About" and "Tools" (sorry hehe)~~
- Widgetize footer (need to manually change social links and text in footer right now)
- Add comment system
- Sidebar:  No plans
- Cleanup CSS
- Cleanup HTML
- Fix WordPress function references and optimize loop
- Add post meta information, maybe.  It isn't in minimawp so I'm not sure I'll actually do it.  This is just here as a mindmap snippet.

## Misc

Currently I use W3C to validate HTML stuff while I'm hacking this up.
